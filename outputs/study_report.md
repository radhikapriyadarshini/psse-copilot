## Transient Stability Study Report

**Study Objective**  
Perform transient stability analysis for a lg fault at Bus 7
to assess rotor angle and voltage stability.

**Assumptions**
- Power flow solved prior to dynamic simulation
- Dynamic models properly assigned
- Simulation time step: 0.01 s
- Fault clearing time: 0.2 s

**Evaluation Criteria**
- Rotor angle separation < 180°
- Post-fault voltage recovery acceptable

**Engineering Notes**
- If instability observed, reduce clearing time or add controls
